										<h1>INTRO</h1>
									</header>
									<p>My name is Anandu krishnan H , I was born and brought up in the state of kerala in India. Great fascination for technology and interest in mathematics together motivate me to learn engineering and choose a career as an engineer.
										After my schooling I took an undergrad course in electrical and electronics engineering, and I believed in the concept of learning through experience and experiments.I am interested in research and wishing to come up with innovative technological solutionsn to meet
									    challenges and problems faced by the society.My current areas of  interest are as follows.</br></p>
									 <p> As climate change and global warming are the major challenges faced by the humanity today, sustainable technology is the need of the hour. Due to these reasons the renewable energy and electric vehicles are at centre stage. Globally several government took initiative to promote the use of EV and 
									   came up with policies and strategies. But what is lacking is affordable technology, keeping thi challenge in mind I tried to develop an efficent inerface to connect photovoltaic and EV fast charger to grid in one of my projects.  </br>
									   Electric mobility is a concept that is going to transform the transportation sector. It involves electric vehicles, high speed bullet train connecting cities, celebrated hyperloop concept, maglev etc.This will enhance connectivity and improvemrnt in logistics that will boost the economies around the world.
									   For this transformation I believe power electronics is going to play a crucial role, whether it be in the development of efficent converters or in the development of intelligent motor controllers. We can even think of solar powered airplanes that will make air travel much cheaper.But major challenge in all this is efficent battery systems.
									   As an alternative to battery hydrogen fuel cells are suggeted which can be refueled in the same way as that of gasoline, but the problem here is immature technology.</br></p>
								      <p>Researches are going on to find a replacement for the silicon switches.The most interested candidates are silicon carbide and gallium nitride switches. If frequency of operation can be raised then size of devices can be reduced, combined with this is reduction in losses. If losses are reduced temperature rise will be less 
								       and thus less cooling requirement. If we are able to achieve this then we can go for high power density compact designs, which I like to call as high power integraded circuit design. Similar to the way millions of signal tranistors are arranged in IC chips, it may be possible to arrange high power switches and design a power IC chips. But the major
									   challenge lies in designing magnetic part, since they are bulky, issues related to saturation and lot. So we have to come up with new efficent materials or define new physics to address this challenge.
